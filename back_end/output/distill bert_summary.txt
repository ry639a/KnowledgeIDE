- Compress BERT via knowledge distillation performed during pretraining, yielding a smaller Transformer (DistilBERT) that is faster and lighter while preserving most of BERT’s accuracy.
- Remove next sentence prediction (NSP) and simplify the architecture (no token-type embeddings, no pooler) to streamline the model.

Setup:
- Teacher: BERT-base (12 layers, 12 heads, 768 hidden).
- Student: 6-layer Transformer with same hidden size (768), 12 heads, 3072 FFN; same WordPiece tokenizer and vocabulary; token-type embeddings and pooler removed.
- Initialization: copy every other layer from the teacher to initialize the student.
- Training objective (pretraining-time distillation):
  - Distillation loss: cross-entropy on teacher’s soft targets with temperature T≈2.
  - Masked language modeling (MLM) loss on ground-truth tokens.
  - Cosine embedding loss aligning student and teacher hidden states.
  - Weighted sum (reported weights in paper): KD dominant, with auxiliary MLM and cosine terms.
- Data: same as BERT’s original pretraining (English Wikipedia + BookCorpus).
- Fine-tuning: standard task-specific heads on top of DistilBERT for downstream tasks.

Experiments:
- Benchmarks: GLUE suite; SQuAD v1.1 and v2.0; speed and parameter comparisons.
- Baselines: BERT-base; a comparable 6-layer model trained without distillation; ablations removing each loss term and different initializations.
- Metrics: accuracy/F1 per task; aggregate GLUE score; inference speed (throughput/latency); parameter count.

Results:
- Model efficiency: ~40% fewer parameters than BERT-base (~66M vs ~110M); ~60% faster inference.
- Accuracy retention: ~97% of BERT-base performance on GLUE while being substantially smaller and faster.
- QA: small drop vs BERT-base on SQuAD (F1 within a few points), maintaining competitive performance.
- Ablations: all three loss components contribute; initializing the student from every other teacher layer improves stability and accuracy over random init; distillation during pretraining markedly outperforms training the small model from scratch.

Further Ideas to explore:
- Distill from stronger teachers (RoBERTa, DeBERTa, or task-ensembles) and multilingual teachers for mDistilBERT variants.
- Combine with complementary compression: quantization, structured pruning, low-rank factorization, or weight sharing.
- Progressive or layer-wise distillation schedules; attention-map and intermediate-representation matching beyond final hidden states.
- Domain-adaptive distillation for specialized corpora (biomedical, legal) and task-aware distillation during fine-tuning.
- Early-exit mechanisms and mixture-of-experts for adaptive compute; energy and on-device benchmarks to optimize for mobile/edge deployment.
