If you’re unsure, here are common options—pick one and I’ll summarize it in the requested format:
- Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition (ResNet, 2015)
- Identity Mappings in Deep Residual Networks (2016)
- Mask R-CNN (2017)
- Rethinking ImageNet Pre-training (2018/2019)
- Delving Deep into Rectifiers: Surpassing Human-Level Performance on ImageNet Classification (PReLU, 2015)
- Spatial Pyramid Pooling in Deep Convolutional Networks (SPPnet, 2014)

If you don’t choose, I can default to summarizing “Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition.”
